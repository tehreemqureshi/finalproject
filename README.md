GR901 Final Project Proposal  

## General 
My proposal focuses on the most recent boreal summers of 2020-2024 and in utilizing temperature anomaly datasets to characterize and analyze the warming that we have been seeing globally, and if there are any particular regions with patterns or outlying trends. 
I plan to utilize two different datasets that characterize temperature anomalies using climatologies to analyze how different datasets can differ and be similar and what we can learn in comparing the data.
My project is motivated by my research on spatially co-occurring heat extremes, where I am interested in climate extremes and also analyzing the modern warming signal in terms of the past and future, and in understanding how datasets can differ. 

## Questions
What are your scientific questions?
    1. When analyzing the boreal summers of 2020-2024, what patterns and differences are apparent in the temperature anomaly dataset in terms of warming and regional trends?
    2. What differences in anomalies do we see in NASA GISTEMP and Berkeley Earth datasets among the year of 2020-2024 as well as with the general warming trend?

What are your datasets?
    I will be using both  NASA Goddard's Global Surface Temperature Analysis (GISTEMP) dataset of temperature anomalies as well as Berkeley Earth temperature anomaly data.
    NASA GISTEMP: https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/
    Berkeley Earth: https://berkeleyearth.org/data/

What is the analysis you plan to conduct?
    Using the temperature anomaly datasets, I plan to average, group, and process data for the boreal summer (JJA) on a global and regional scale from 2020-2024 to analyze how warming trends may be observed in the last four years.
    Additionally, I plan on characterizing the warming trend from the start of the instrumental data (1850) for each datasets and to compare how values in anomalies may differ based on the datasets, given the different
    climatologies and methods used to create the data and the different resolutions. With this analysis, I hope to provide further insight on the most recent warmings and how datasets of similar variables may differ from each other.
    I may also use EOF analysis to see the spatial variability of what climate mechanisms may have contributed to the observed patterns.

What are the outcomes that you plan to achieve?
    I hope to develop visuals on the different global/regional anomalies within the specific years of 2020-2024 with a focus on the boreal summer months of June, July, August but also analyzing seasonal variability. 
    I also plan to compare time series data side by side of the different datasets and apply different statistical processing and averaging to my data, including
    groupby functions, rolling means, linear regressions, standard deviation, and further analysis to understand the temperature anomaly data. I hope to be able to communicate
    what we are seeing in the anomaly data for the most recent years and how the data can be interpreted.
